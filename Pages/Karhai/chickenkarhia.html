        Chicken Karahi

        is one of them. Chicken Karahi Recipe or Chicken Kadai is a dish from the Indian subcontinent known for its
        spicy flavour. It is notable in the kitchens of northern India and Pakistan. The Pakistani version contains no
        peppers or onions, while the North Indian version uses bell peppers. The dish is prepared in a karahi. The
        cooking time for Karahi is between 30 to 50 minutes. The word Karhai means “wok”. Traditionally, karahi was a
        round cast iron pot. This gives it strength and good heat dissipation. It also had a ring-shaped handle on each
        side for easy handling. This dish is traditionally cooked in a wok over high heat and is therefore called Karahi
        chicken. This dish is one of the popular dishes in Pakistan and also cooked in functions and celebrations.
        Almost every restaurant and hotel serves this dish.

        There are many types of Chicken Karahi but here we will tell you about some of the dishes of Karahis.
